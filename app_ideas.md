## Top Four Apps:
- Creating a gift card app
    - Category: Lifestyle
    - Mobile: touch (designing the gift app/card), notifies when the person opened/recieved the app/card, connects to debit/credit card (sending money through app) 
    - Story: User can design their own app as a present for a friend. They can also send money through the app to the person.
    - Market: Anyone who has access to a smartphone and a debit card.
    - Habit: Maybe a few times a month. It depends on how many special occassions the person would want to create an app for.
    - Scope: This app can range from basic to very intricate. It depends on how detailed you want the user to be able to make their app/gift card. If we go with an app that is somewhere in between the two we can definitely get this done with in the timeframe of the course. 




- Study group app
    - Category: social
    - Mobile: notifications (when you receive a message, etc.), location (so you can find nearby students)
    - Story: convenient way to meet other students on campus and do better in classes
    - Market: clearly fits college students, maybe high school students as well
    - Habit: probably not used daily, but would be used regularly (maybe once or twice a week)
    - Scope: would be very lacking without a lot of users, but a good launch plan (i.e. promoting on college campuses) would help. Not sure how challenging it would be to make this; location services could be difficult but that isn't a totally necessary feature.



- Life Hacker App
    - Category: Lifestyle
    - Mobile: Notifications to remind you of your desired schedule
    - Story: Convenient way to organize your habits in order to optimize your lifestyle.
    - Market: Anyone who has access to a smartphone.
    - Habit: Most likely weekly, as users may want to update their health and lifestyle plans every week depending on how detailed their plan might be.
    - Scope: Could be challenging based on the amount of information we want to include. A basic form of this app could be one with just a few focuses like nutrition and exercise. As the app gets more developed it could include more features and lifestyle focuses.
