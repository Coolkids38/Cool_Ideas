## Study Group App

### App Description
  - Community forum platform for students, teachers and tutors to communicate about classes and coordinate study times with classmates. The forum would be public so any student can read about classes they might take in the future. Students currently enrolled in classes will also be able to coordinate with other class members to organize study groups and prepare for projects and exams. 

### General App Attributes


- **Category**: Social Networking
- **Mobile**: Website would work but mobile is more convenient for location based tracking and quickly access the app. 
- **Story**: Convenient way to meet other students on campus and do better in classes.
- **Market**: Clearly fits college students, maybe high school students as well.
- **Habit**: Probably not used daily, but would be used regularly (maybe once or twice a week).
- **Scope**: Would be very lacking without a lot of users, but a good launch plan (i.e. promoting on college campuses) would help. Not sure how challenging it would be to make this; location services could be difficult but that isn't a totally necessary feature.
